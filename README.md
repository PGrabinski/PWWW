# PWWW
University course: Web development
Supervision: dr Cezary Juszczak

### Outline

This course covered basics of the web development in a kind of oldschool style. Despite that, it gave me more understanding how does the web works. It covered:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript with JQuery and JQuery.ui
* PHP (vanilla)
* SQL (SQLite and MySQL)
* SVG, Canvas, etc.

### My work
My solutions are given on [my home website](https://www.pgrabinski.pl/PWWW "Web Development Course").
I have solved every list for the maximal grade (5 of 2-5 scale). Additionaly, I have prepared a presentation covering basics of the Bootsrap framework. It was an additional condition for me as I asked for a remote passing way.
Two pieces of which I am especially happy are:
* [Shop made with PHP and Bootstrap frontend](http://pgrabinski.pl/PWWW/Lista10/3/index.php "Nerdshop")
* [Image puzzles with JQuery.ui](http://pgrabinski.pl/PWWW/Lista6/3.html "Puzzles")

The code is not high quality as the course was rather a kind of a run 'n' gun course showing a load of different technologies with stress mostly on getting results not mantaining them.
